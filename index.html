<p style="font-size: 30px;">Air navigation is navigation whiles flying. It is used by pilots in aircrafts to know their exact position and to find their way. This is important because getting 
lost whiles flying is very dangerous. There are generally two types of air navigation depending on the weather. In good weather, pilots navigate visually with maps.
When the weather is bad and they are not able to see the ground, they use special radio navigation instuments or the Air Traffic Control(A.T.C) navigates them. The
first kind of navigation is called Visual Flight Rules(V.F.R) navigation. The second one is Instrument Flight Rules(I.F.R) navigation.</p>

<h1 style="color: red"><center><u> VFR navigation </u></center></h1>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">Under VFR, pilots use a map and a compass to look on the ground. The weather must be good enough to let them see the ground. They cannot fly into clouds because
they can get lost. Pilots also have to lookout for other aircrafts. It is their responsibility to make sure they do not get too close to other aircrafts. This
 technique is called "See and aviod"</p>

<h1 style="color: red"><center><u> IFR navigation </u></center></h1>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">Flying under IFR, pilots cannot fly where ever they want.</p>
